            <p>
                This section defines the central purpose of the dissertation study and the specific research
                questions guiding each strand. It includes the qualitative autoethnographic research question,
                the quantitative tracker-data research question, and the mixed methods integration question
                that brings both strands together.

        <div class="content-section" role="region" aria-label="PurposeStatement">
            <h3 id="content-section">Purpose Statement</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this concurrent convergent mixed methods auto-ethnography is to examine how my lived experiences 
                with technology across my academic and professional development have shaped my current mathematics teaching 
                practices, particularly my commitment to equity and access in mathematics education. My definition of mixed methods 
                research is: Mixed methods research is the systematic integration of qualitative and quantitative methods at the 
                level of research questions, data collection, and analysis, wherein quantitative approaches describe what is 
                occurring and qualitative approaches explain why. Like a complex mathematical function that requires both its 
                algebraic form and plotted values to reveal its full behavior across contexts, MMR methods generate comprehensive 
                understanding that neither could achieve independently. In a convergent design, qualitative and quantitative data 
                are collected concurrently, analyzed separately, and then merged (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). The reason for 
                collecting both quantitative and qualitative data is to leverage the complementarity of the two forms of data, 
                allowing documented patterns in my technology experiences to work alongside narrative accounts of critical 
                moments to produce a more complete understanding of my development as an educator than would be obtained by either 
                type of data separately.</p>
            <p>The quantitative correlational strand will use constant comparative analysis of artifact patterns to examine 
                documented patterns in my technology experiences across my academic and professional development and how these 
                relate to observable shifts in my mathematics teaching practices. Data sources will include my auto-ethnography 
                tracker, written artifacts, projects from courses throughout my undergraduate and graduate career, and childhood 
                artifacts when available. These materials will be analyzed to identify patterns in technology interaction types, 
                frequency, and contexts, alongside metrics of student engagement and performance drawn from my teaching practice. 
                The quantitative data will be analyzed using constant comparative analysis (Charmaz, 2014; Glaser & Strauss, 1967), 
                applying grounded theory tools, procedures, and methodological frameworks to bring systematic rigor to the 
                identification and documentation of patterns across artifacts.</p>
            <p>The qualitative auto-ethnographic strand will concurrently collect self-interview data alongside the same artifact 
                sources used in the quantitative strand—the auto-ethnography tracker, written artifacts, course projects, and childhood 
                materials—to explore the critical incidents in my technology experiences that have fundamentally influenced my 
                pedagogical philosophy and classroom practices (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011). Data collection will occur continuously 
                throughout my engagement with this research, taking place at my home and wherever I choose to work on this project. 
                The qualitative data will be analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis with pattern coding techniques 
                (Saldaña, 2021) to identify recurring themes around the meaning I make of pivotal moments in my technology journey 
                and how critical incidents have shaped my commitment to serving students who have been underserved by traditional 
                mathematics instruction.</p>
            <p>The quantitative and qualitative strands will be integrated through side-by-side joint displays of the quantitative 
                patterns and qualitative themes (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Guetterman, Fetters, & Creswell, 2015), as well as 
                through narrative weaving that illuminates the complementary insights emerging from both forms of data. This 
                integration will reveal the extent to which documented patterns in my technology experiences complement and expand 
                upon narrative accounts of critical moments in my development as an educator focused on equity and access in 
                mathematics, ultimately yielding a holistic understanding of how technology has shaped my teaching identity and practice.</p>
