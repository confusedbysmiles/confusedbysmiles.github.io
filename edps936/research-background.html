                This section contextualizes the dissertation study within the broader sociopolitical and
                educational landscape surrounding Algebra 1 as a gatekeeping course. It examines the
                particular challenges faced by students who are retaking the course and grounds the study
                in existing scholarship on mathematics equity and access.

        <div class="placeholder-notice" role="region" aria-label="Content placeholder">
            <p>My project is the start of my dissertation which is an auto-ethnographic study examining how my lived experiences as a mathematics 
                educator shape my pedagogical approaches to equity and access in the classroom, particularly when working with students retaking Algebra 1. 
                These students—many of whom have been under-served by traditional mathematics instruction—represent a population that challenges me to 
                constantly interrogate my own assumptions about what it means to teach mathematics well and for whom our current systems work.</p>
            <p>My research emerges from a career trajectory that moved from the "hard sciences" through K-12 teaching into graduate study, a 
                journey that fundamentally shifted my epistemological stance from primarily quantitative to increasingly qualitative ways of knowing. 
                This evolution itself became a puzzle worth examining: how do my formative experiences as both a student and teacher influence the 
                pedagogical choices I make today? When I design learning experiences for students who have historically struggled in mathematics, 
                which parts of my past am I drawing from, and which am I actively working against?</p>
            <p>To explore these questions, I developed a web-based Dissertation Tracker that serves as both research tool and data source. The tracker 
                captures three interconnected strands of my experience: formative memories with technology, mathematics, and education spanning my entire 
                career; detailed documentation of my pedagogical decision-making process when designing learning tools; and explicit connections I notice 
                between past experiences and present practice. This approach—what I think of as "reflection through making"—positions the act of 
                systematic documentation as the research itself.</p>
            <p>This study employs a mixed methods approach that integrates the depth of auto-ethnographic inquiry with systematic data analysis. 
                Following my understanding that quantitative methods describe WHAT is happening while qualitative methods explain WHY, I'm treating 
                my tracker entries as both narrative data and quantifiable phenomena. The quantitative strand involves systematic coding and pattern 
                analysis across my documented entries—tracking frequencies of themes, temporal patterns in my reflections, and categorical relationships 
                between past experiences and present pedagogical choices. The qualitative strand provides the interpretive depth necessary to 
                understand what these patterns mean, exploring the lived experience behind the data points through thick description and reflexive analysis. 
                These strands integrate throughout the research process: the act of logging entries generates both types of data simultaneously, 
                and analysis moves iteratively between identifying patterns (what themes recur across my teaching career?) and interpreting meaning 
                (why do certain memories surface when I'm designing for student agency?). The goal is not to generalize my experience to other educators, 
                but to deeply understand how one teacher's biography shapes their present practice in ways that might illuminate broader questions about 
                who gets to do mathematics and how we might better serve students whom traditional approaches have failed.</p>
