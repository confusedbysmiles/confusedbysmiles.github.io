            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                When our AI capstone class kicked off, I immediately thought about the Management Information Systems course I teach at Seton Hill. Having taught it before with materials I wasn't thrilled about, I finally had the chance to really overhaul it instead of just getting handed last year's export at the last minute. I decided to rebuild it for both my traditional undergrads and my adult learners, knowing full well I'd need to redo parts next year because the textbook is so outdated.
            </p>
            <p>
                I structured everything around a meta-cognitive framework to help students think like managers - not just analyzing data, but considering how systems integrate, their practical uses, and potential pitfalls. One thing that worked surprisingly well was sharing how I used AI to develop parts of the class. This created an accountability system for me and showed students real examples of AI in action, which is tough to demonstrate in an asynchronous environment. The results, student feedback, and all my teaching materials are included in the walk-through video and Google Drive link below.
